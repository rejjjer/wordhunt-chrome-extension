# wordhunt-chrome-extension

Google Chrome extension to transalate words with [Wordhunt](https://wooordhunt.ru/) dictionary.

Select the necessary word with Ctrl key pressed, and the extension will show a dialog with the word translation.

I created this extension for myself, because [Wordhunt](https://wooordhunt.ru/) is the best English-Russian dictionary IMO.

## Installation

- Clone the repository
- Enable developer mode for extensions in Google Chrome
- Click **Load Unpacked** button and select the directory with the cloned extension
